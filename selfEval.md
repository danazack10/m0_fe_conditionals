# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Fairly confident, so long as I remember to use three equal signs in my conditional statements as opposed to one.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
Fiarly confident.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
Fairly confident, so long as I remember to write "else if" instead of "if else."
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Somewhere between 445-60 minutes. This was about what I anticipated.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to practice creating files and becoming more comfortable with terminal commands in general. I also need to practice cloning directories from github to my local computer. I will keep practicing!
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I am not sure how to solve code challenge "mild" or "spicy." If I have time, I will spend some time on google learning about how to write conditional statements involving multiples of numbers. I may also reach out to my classmates to ask this question if I cannot find the answer on my own.
